if(num==0)--> return 0;
else {
	sum+=num/10; --> This Step Becomes Quite Unnecessary while using Recursion 
	return sum+sumOfNumbers(num/10);
}
----------------------------
We can use log to find the number of digits in a given number 
-----------------------------
variables which are passed to functions calls in the recursion are available throughout all the calls . whereas the variables which are only 
defined inside of a function and are not passed to different functions remain available for that specific function call
-----------------------------
n--   --> it is the post decrement of variable 'n' meaning first use the variable n and then decrement it ;
--n --> decrement the variable first and then use it 
-----------------------------
Palindrome --> 1.Reversing the Enitre Number 
			   2.Without Reversing {Only POSSIBLE if the number is given in string or array format }
-------------------------------
Counting the Number of Zeros in a Number 
1. Taking the COunt Variable Inside the Function {here we will keep on passing the updated value of count to the post function call }
2. Taking a Global Count Variable {Limited Scope}
